dulasuhla (he's wearing shoes) - This word brings up two points:
1. preserving the prefix - is this an issue for later?
2. animate objects are allowed - he's wearing him as shoes? can you do that? smile emoticon maybe we just leave these
in because you can technically make the conjugation, even if it doesn't make sense.


on answer to 2 - it's the same as kill - I only thought that could be animate, but the conjugation is there for inanimate.
We *could categorize the verbs so that we know they will be animate only or inanimate only.  I do agree - the conjugation
is available even if it doesn't make sense; we can make whatever change we want to accommodate


on 1 - preserving the prefix such as shoes being plural and this will conjugate but not add the /d-/ correct?
if that's the case, then yes.  I'll have to take the stem and determine the plural prefix.  That is coming up and will
probably be the next thing I look at before I move on to past tense work.


Not sure what you meant for point 1, but what I meant is that the conjugations should come up with plural object/action
(d- or de-, as appropriate to the next sound), or wi (wudeliga) or ni (nigaliha) or whatever is on them.
